`next lint` is deprecated and will be removed in Next.js 16.
For new projects, use create-next-app to choose your preferred linter.
For existing projects, migrate to the ESLint CLI:
npx @next/codemod@canary next-lint-to-eslint-cli .

 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /home/soufiane/package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `outputFileTracingRoot` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#caveats for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles: 
   * /home/soufiane/Bureau/gestion restaurant/package-lock.json
